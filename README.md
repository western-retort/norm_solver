# norm_solver
norm solvers . these are basic types so they can mostly do 1 , 2 and infinity

norms is a way of measuring matrices and vectors . used to compare 2 matrices or vectors`
== Vector norms
The basic formula is the vpnorm.png . p is which type of norm we r calculating

=  p=1 / norm1 / manhattan norm (TOTAL LENGTH OF VECTOR IE Y+X)
like manhattan we travel vertical and horizontal to get to a point . 


= p=2 / norm 2 / ecludian norm (SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM ORIGIN)
ysquare + xsquare = value . simple points we use

= max norm / infinity norm (FIND ABSOLUTE VALUE OF LARGEST ELEMENT IN VECTOR)





==matrix norm

=norm 1 (SUM THE ABSOLUTE VALUES OF EACH COLUMN THEN TAKE LARGEST SUMMATION)
also called column sum norm 

=infinity norm - row sum norm
